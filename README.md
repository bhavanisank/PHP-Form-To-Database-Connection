# PHP-Form-To-Database-Connection

# Description
This project displays a form for the users to input their first name, last name, Gender, Adress, Email Adress. When the user clicks the submit button the form data will be sent to a server side script using the HTTP POST method likely for a storage in a database.



The PHP script is designed to handle the form data submitted by the user.It establishes a connection to a MySQL database, retrieves the form data, constructs and executes an SQL INSERT query to insert the data into a table, and then provides appropriate messages based on the success or failure of the query.
